		As  is common in France, I had chosen to study the second year of my major at a different institute, 
		as courses are compatible between different universities. 
		I studied Software Engineering major in my 2nd year of masters the purpose of which 
		is to prepare students for the job market. The courses provided us the access to any
		part of an SDLC (we were trained to manage projects, specify, design, implement, and control the quality).
