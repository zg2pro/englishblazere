	<field>Technology watch: I consider as a must to keep up-to-date. <br/>
	Whatever could be the context I should be able to propose up-to-date technologic solutions
	as well as up-to-date process guidelines.<br/>
	My cross-cultural career provides me cross-cultural methods, and I love that.<br/><br/></field>
	<field>Polyvalent skill-set: I like to have more and more plugins on my Eclipse IDE. I ecourage self-learning and 
	I am also a self-learner, this is how I often got familiar with new languages or even new frameworks. 
	Those people who can manage working on all the tools, all architectures, and use all kinds of codes, 
	are called... Guru!<br/><br/></field>
	<field>Quality: My experience taught me that end-to-end development lifecycles should not be under-estimated,
	internal projects might have their importance and need support because they keep people motivated,
	updated and efficient. 
	Continuous improvement attracts new opportunities should it be for the business
	or the private concern of each contributor. I want my job to give me the occasion to do
	things the right way.<br/><br/></field>
	<field>Participatory democracy: management has turned into coaching and encouraging,
	rather than ordering and directing. And that forces managers and leaders to be open
	to being taught by their employees. That's the way I want to handle my team improvement. 
	I also strongly believe <i>a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</i> Team building is
	fundamental, no one can be let down.<br/><br/></field>
	<field>A bridge is to be created between East and West, I feel confident now I can be
	an actor in this play.</field>
