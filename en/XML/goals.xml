	<field>Technology watch: I consider it as a must to keep myself up-to-date. <br/>
	Whatever could be the context I should be able to propose up-to-date technological solutions
	as well as up-to-date process guidelines.<br/>
	My cross-cultural career provides me cross-cultural methods, and I love that.<br/><br/></field>
	<field>Polyvalent skill-set: I like to have more and more plugins on my Eclipse IDE. I encourage self-learning and 
	I am also a self-learner. I often acquire new languages and new frameworks. 
	<br/><br/></field>
	<field>Quality: My experience taught me that end-to-end development lifecycles should not be let up,
	internal projects might have their importance and need support because they keep people motivated,
	updated and efficient. 
	Continuous improvement attracts new opportunities when it comes to either business
	or the private concern of each contributor. <br/><br/></field>
	<field>Participatory democracy: management has turned into coaching and encouraging,
	rather than ordering and directing. And that forces managers and leaders to be open
	to being taught by their employees. I believe this will be an appropriate teamwork orientation. 
	I also strongly believe <i>a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</i> Team building is
	fundamental, no one can be let down.<br/><br/></field>
	<field>Awards: I had felt attracted to research issues since I started my masters degree and
	today I hope I can propose a PhD thesis subject someday under the title of R&amp;D engineer in
	any of my next establishments. I am as well greatly attracted by a Sun certification, 
	an OMG certification, or any suitable and valuable computing certification.<br/><br/></field>
	<field>A bridge is to be created between East and West, I feel confident now I can be
	an actor in this play.</field>
